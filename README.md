## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use flexbox to vertically and horizontally center a div.

 
```css
.container {
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

/* .card is the child div of .container and which needed to be vertically and horizontally centered */
```


### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox by Chris Coyier](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
